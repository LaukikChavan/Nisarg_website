								<p>Cyclone Nisarga made landfall with unusual force in the state of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, a city of about 20 million. The region rarely experiences cyclones, and the last storm to threaten Mumbai with such intensity was more than 70 years ago.</p>
								<p> The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said nearly 20,000 people in Mumbai were shifted to the temporary shelters and 30,000 others shifted on their own to safer locations. The BMC said 117 trees have fallen in Mumbai. Nine incidents of wall or portion of house collapse have been reported in Mumbai so far.</p>
								<p>39 incidents of short-circuit were reported in Mumbai due to the impact of the cyclone and nine incidents of house fall, including three that were from south Mumbai and four from western suburbs.Over 100,000 people, including coronavirus patients, moved to safety as rare cyclonic storm lashes Mumbai and suburbs.Four people died and as many were injured in cyclone-related incidents as cyclone 'Nisarga'.</p>
								<p> A weekend getaway destination for Mumbaiâ€™s celebrities and tycoons, suffered worse damage as the cyclone tore roofs off homes and overturned mobile food stalls. Luxurious villas set amid coconut groves on the beach took a battering.</p>
