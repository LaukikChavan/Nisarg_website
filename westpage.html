                  <p> West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India along the Bay of
                    Bengal. With over 91 million inhabitants it is India's fourth most populous
                    state. West Bengal is also the worl's seventh most populous subnational
                    entity. West Bengal is the thirteenth-largest Indian state, with an area of
                    88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mi). It also borders the Indian states of Odisha,
                    Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital is Kolkata (Calcutta)
                    the seventh-largest city in India, and center of the third-largest
                    metropolitan area in the country. West Bengal includes the Darjeeling
                    Himalayan hill region, the Ganges delta, the Rarh region and the coastal
                    Sundarbans. The main ethnic group is the Bengalis, with Bengali Hindus
                    forming the demographic majority.West Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the
                    Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The state has a
                    total area of 88,752 square kilometres (34,267 sq mi).[2] The Darjeeling
                    Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state is a part of
                    the eastern Himalayas mountain range. In this region is Sandakfu, which,
                    at 3,636 m (11,929 ft), is the highest peak in the state.[89] The narrow
                    Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains, which in
                    turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region
                    intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau
                    and high lands. A small coastal region is in the extreme south, while the
                    Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges
                    delta.The main river in West Bengal is the Ganges, which divides into two
                    branches. One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma, or Pôdda, while the
                    other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River.
                    The Farakka barrage over the Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river
                    by a feeder canal. West Bengal's climate varies from tropical savanna in
                    the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons
                    are summer, the rainy season, a short autumn and winter. The highest
                    daytime temperatures range from 38 °C (100 °F) to 45 °C (113 °F). West
                    Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Ocean monsoon that
                    moves in a southeast to northwest direction. Monsoons bring rain to the
                    whole state from June to September. Heavy rainfall of above 250
                    centimetres (98 in) is observed in the Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, and Cooch
                    Behar district.

                  <p>As of 2015, West Bengal has the sixth-highest GSDP in India. GSDP at current
                    prices (base 2004–2005) has increased from Rs 2,086.56 billion in 2004–05 to
                    Rs 8,00,868 crores in 2014–2015, reaching Rs 10,21,000 crores in 2017–18.
                    GSDP percent growth at current prices varied from a low of 10.3% in
                    2010–2011 to a high of 17.11% in 2013–2014. The growth rate was 13.35% in
                    2014–2015.[124] The state's per capita income has lagged the all India
                    average for over two decades. As of 2014–2015, per capita NSDP at current
                    prices was Rs 78,903. Per-capita NSDP growth rate at current prices varied
                    from 9.4% in 2010–2011 to a high of 16.15% in 2013–2014. The growth rate was
                    12.62% in 2014–2015. In 2015–2016, percentage share of Gross Value Added
                    (GVA) at factor cost by economic activity at constant price (base year
                    2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery—4.84%, Industry 18.51% and
                    Services 66.65%. It has been observed that there has been a slow but steady
                    decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years.
                    Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the
                    state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane and wheat are the
                    state's top five crops. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts;
                    the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high-quality teas. State
                    industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western
                    highlands, and the Haldia Port region. The Durgapur-Asansol colliery belt is
                    home to a number of steel plants. Important manufacturing industries
                    include: engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables,
                    steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches
                    and wagons. Natural resources like tea and jute in nearby areas has made
                    West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries. The economy of
                    West Bengal has witnessed many surprising changes in direction. The
                    agricultural sector in particular rose to 8.33% in 2010–11 before tumbling
                    to −4.01% in 2012–13.</p>
