      In the Mid of May there was an Super Cyclone named Amphan hits the state
      of West Bengal. It was the first tropical cyclone of 2020 North Indian
      Ocean Cyclone. This Amphan cyclone originated from a low pressure area
      persisting a couple hundred miles (300 km) east of Colombo, Sri Lanka, on
      13 May 2020. On 18 May, at approximately 12:00 UTC, Amphan reached its
      peak intensity with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of 240 km/h (150 mph),
      1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph), and a minimum
      central barometric pressure of 920 mbar (27.17 inHg). On 20 May, between
      10:00 and 11:00 UTC, the cyclone made landfall in West Bengal. At the
      time, the JTWC estimated Amphan's 1-minute sustained winds to be 155 km/h
      (100 mph). Amphan rapidly weakened once inland and dissipated shortly
      thereafter. Coastal areas in West Bengal comprising East Midnapur, North
      24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Kolkata, Hooghly and Howrah as well as
      Odisha were affected by the cyclone. At 18th May 2020, the Cyclone arrived
      in the state of West Bengal. Around 5:30 p.m. IST (12:00 UTC), Amphan made
      landfall as a Very Severe Cyclonic storm near Bakkhali, West Bengal with
      winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). As it moved further inland, it rapidly
      weakened. Just six hours after landfall, the JTWC downgraded it to a
      Category 1-equivalent cyclone and issued its final warning on the system
      as it became disorganized. Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist at the Indian
      Institute of Tropical Meteorology and lead author of IPCC Oceans and
      Cryosphere, said: "Our research shows that high ocean temperatures are
      conducive for rapid intensification of cyclones in the north Indian Ocean.
      In the current case, the Bay of Bengal has been particularly warm. Some of
      the buoys in the Bay of Bengal registered maximum surface temperatures of
      32-34 degrees Celsius consecutively for the first two weeks of May. These
      are record temperatures driven by climate change — we have never seen such
      high values until now."

      Public works departments were called upon by the government of Odisha to
      ensure infrastructure resiliency; crews and backup systems for electricity
      and telecommunications were deployed to meet these needs, establishing
      helplines for emergency response. Rail and vehicular traffic in Odisha and
      West Bengal was halted or rerouted. The Shramik train service for migrant
      workers was halted in both states for up to four days, with service
      expected to be curtailed in the storm's aftermath. Other migrants
      travelling to Odisha were asked to wait out the storm. Subhas Chandra Bose
      International Airport in Kolkata was closed until 21 May, with planes
      evacuating or chocked and the airport terminal roof fortified to minimize
      damage. Teams from the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force and National
      Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were pre-positioned across districts in
      Odisha and West Bengal on 17 May to assist in preparations for Amphan and
      render aid where necessary, with additional units placed on standby; these
      units could be readily airlifted to affected areas onboard Indian Air
      Force transport aircraft. The National Disaster Management Authority
      advised that these crews and other first responders would also need
      personal protective equipment and N95 masks due to the ongoing pandemic. A
      diving team from the Indian Navy was sent to Kolkata to aid relief
      efforts, with ships from the navy placed on standby for relief operations.
      An IMD yellow alert was active for 13 of Kerala's 14 districts on 18 May,
      while an orange alert was issued by the agency for West Bengal,
      anticipating extensive damage in six districts. Amphan made landfall near
      Bakhali in West Bengal at 2:30 p.m. IST on 20 May, buffeting the region
      with strong winds and heavy rains. Although the extent of fatalities was
      less than initially feared, the cyclone's effects were nonetheless
      widespread and deadly. West Bengal, the epicenter of the cyclone's
      landfall, saw the most widespread damage from Amphan. The storm was
      considered the strongest to hit the region in over a decade. At least 86
      people died in West Bengal; most of the fatalities were due to
      electrocution or the collapse of homes. The state government estimated
      that the storm caused at least ₹1 trillion (US$13.2 billion) in damage and
      directly affected 70 percent of the state's population. Chief Minister
      Banerjee described the storm's effects there as worse than that of
      COVID-19.[49] An estimated storm surge of 5 m (16 ft) inundated a wide
      swath of coastal communities and communications were severed. The greatest
      inundations were expected in the Sundarbans, where flooding could extend
      15 km (9.3 mi) inland. Embankments in the region were overtaken by the
      surge, leading to inundation of the islands in the Sundarbans. Bridges
      linking islands to the Indian mainland were swept away. The cyclone
      produced sustained winds of 112 km/h (70 mph) and gusts to 190 km/h (120
      mph) recorded by Alipore observatory, Kolkata, West Bengal, damaging homes
      and uprooting trees and electric poles Wind speed along coastal areas were
      measured up to 150–160 km/h (93–99 mph).In Dum dum Netaji Subhas Chandra
      Bose International Airport recorded a damaging winds up to 133 km/h (83
      mph) overturned vehicles and snapped approximately 10,000 trees. The
      Calcutta Municipal Corporation stated that Amphan toppled over 4,000
      electric poles, leaving much of the city without power for over 14 hours.
      At least 19 people were killed in Kolkata. The storm also triggered
      widespread flooding around the city. 236 mm of rain was recorded in
      Kolkata. Downed power lines caused power outages across West Bengal,
      prompting CM Banerjee ordered power supplies to be cut in the two states
      of 24 Parganas as a precautionary measure. In North 24 Parganas, 2 people
      were killed and up to 5,500 homes were damaged. Thousands of mud homes
      were damaged in the neighboring Hooghly district. A million homes were
      damaged in South 24 Parganas and breached embankments led to the flooding
      of villages and swaths of cropland. About 26,000 homes were destroyed in
      Gosaba. Saltwater inundation affected surrounding areas following damage
      to 19 km (12 mi) of nearby embankments. Across West Bengal, 88,000
      hectares (217,000 acres) of rice paddies and 200,000 hectares (500,000
      acres) of vegetable and sesame crops were damaged.
